<p>Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.</p>

<p>Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.</p>

<p>A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.</p>

<p>For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.</p>

<p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

<p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, in a quaint village nestled amidst a vibrant forest, there lived a spirited young girl named Lily. Her heart brimmed with warmth, her laughter filled the air with joy, and her unwavering love for nature was a flame that danced within her soul.

Lily's days were woven with the delicate threads of wonder and curiosity. She would wander through the woodland, surrendering herself to its enchantment. The melodious songs of birds embraced her ears, sunlight filtering through the leaves painted a mosaic of colors upon her skin, and the whispers of the wind stirred her imagination.

It was on one such day that Lily's meandering path led her to a tender, injured fawn. Compassion welled up within her as she approached the gentle creature with utmost care, ensuring her presence carried solace rather than fear. The deer, sensing Lily's benevolence, acknowledged her intentions with a delicate nudge, forging an unspoken bond of trust.

Driven by a deep-rooted empathy, Lily made it her mission to help the ailing fawn. With nimble hands and a tender heart, she fashioned a splint for the wounded leg, carefully cradling the delicate bones with leaves and branches. The babbling stream nearby offered crisp, life-giving water, quenching the deer's thirst as Lily showered it with unwavering affection.

Day after day, Lily returned to her newfound companion, tending to its needs with unwavering devotion. Time became an ally, gently mending the deer's injury and nourishing its strength. Together, they roamed the forest, their bond growing stronger with each passing adventure, as if the universe had stitched them together with invisible threads of kinship.

News of Lily's remarkable connection with the deer whispered through the village, captivating the hearts of its inhabitants. They marveled at her selflessness, her radiant spirit, and the harmony she shared with the natural world. Inspired by her kindness, the villagers rallied together, forming a collective embrace around the forest and its creatures, ensuring its protection and preservation for generations to come.

Lily's tale transcended time, its essence etching itself into the collective memory of the villagers. It became a tale of legends, a testament to the extraordinary power of compassion and the profound interconnection between humans and the realm of nature. And in that cherished village, the spirit of empathy and stewardship danced hand in hand, weaving a tapestry of reverence guided by the indelible memory of a young girl named Lily and her extraordinary friendship with a deer.</p>
